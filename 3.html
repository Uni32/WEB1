    Waking up begins with saying
    ''am'' and ''now''.
    Jennifer, I'm not gonna tell you again.
    For the past eight months waking
    up has actually hurt.
    The cold realization that
    I'm still here slowly sets in.
    I was never teribly fond of waking up.
    I was never one to jump out of bed and
    greet the day with a smile like Jim was.
    I used to want to punch him sometimes
    in the morning he was so happy.
    I always used to tell him that only fools
    greet the day with a smile...
    ...that only fools possibly
    escape the simple truth.
    That now isn't simply now.
    It's a cold reminder.</p>
