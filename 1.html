    Waking up begins with saying
    ''am'' and ''now''.
    Jennifer, I'm not gonna tell you again.
    For the past eight months waking
    up has actually hurt.
    The cold realization that
    I'm still here slowly sets in.
    I was never teribly fond of waking up.
    I was never one to jump out of bed and
    greet the day with a smile like Jim was.
    I used to want to punch him sometimes
    in the morning he was so happy.
    I always used to tell him that only fools
    greet the day with a smile...
    ...that only fools possibly
    escape the simple truth.
    That now isn't simply now.
    It's a cold reminder.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:45px;margin-bottom:45px;">
    One day later than yesterday.
    One year later than last year.
    And that sooner or later it will come.
    He used to laugh at me and then
    give me kiss on the cheek.
    It takes time in the morning
    for me to become George.
    The time to adjust to what is expected
    of George and how he is to behave.
    By the time I have dressed and
    put the final layer of polish...
    ...on the now slightly stiff
    but quite perfect George...
    ...I know fully what part
    I'm supposed to play
    Looking in the mirror staring back at me
    isn't so much as a face...
    ...as the expression of a predicament.
    Just get through the goddamn day.
    A bit melodramatic, I guess.</p>

  <p> But then again...
  ...my heart has been broken.
  I feel as if I am sinking, drowning...
  ...can't breathe.
  Aren't you going to say something?
  Are you kidding? It's spectacular.
  What are you doing?
  Just stop it.
  Stop it.
  I don't think that you're quite
  ready for life in a glass house.
  Drapes, old man.
  You're the one who is always saying
  that we are invisible.
  That's not exactly what I meant.
  For the first time in my life
  I can't see my future.
  Every day goes by in a haze.
  But today I have decided
  will be different.
  Finally. You know it's been
  raining here all day.
  I've been trapped in this house
  waiting for you to call.</p>

  I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.
  I'm calling for Mr. George Falconer.
  I'm sorry, I was expecting someone else.
  Yes sir, you have indeed called the...
  ...correct number. How may I help you?
  - This is Harold Ackerley.
  I'm Jim's cousin.
  Of course.
  Yes, good evening Mr. Ackerley.
  I'm afraid I'm calling with
  some bad news.
  There has been a car accident.
  An accident?
  There has been a lot of snow here
  lately and the roads have been icy.
  On his way into town,
  Jim lost control of his car.
  It was instantaneous apparently.
  It happened late yesterday, but his
  parents didnt want to call you.
  I see.
  In fact, they don't that
  I'm calling you now.
  But I thought that you should know.
  Thank you.
  I know this must be quite a shock.
  It was for all of us.
  Yes, indeed.
  - Will there be a service?
  - The day after tomorrow.
  Well, I suppose I should
  get off the phone...
  ...and book a plane flight.
  The service is just for family.
  For family, of course.
  Well, thank you for calling.
  - Mr. Ackerley?
  - Yes?
  - May I ask what happened to the dogs?
  - Dogs?
  There was a dog with him but he died.
  Was there another one?
  Yes, there was a small female.
  I don't know, I'm sorry.
  I haven't heard anyone
  mentioning another dog.
  - Well, thank you for calling Mr. Ackerley.
  - Goodbye, Mr. Falconer.
  Hello, Charley.
  How did you know it was me?
  Charlotte, nobody else calls me
  before eight in the morning.
  I didn't call too early, did I?
  You sound grumpy.
  No, I have a headache.
  Listen, I was going to call you actually.
  Is too late to change my mind about tonight.
  No, of course not.
  I haven't seen you all week.
  - I'm dying for a dose of you.
  - I know, I'm sorry.
  So great, I'll see you tonight.
